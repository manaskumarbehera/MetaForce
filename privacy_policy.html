    <p>Last updated: September 3, 2023</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the MetaForce Chrome extension ("we", "us" or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We do not collect any personal information. The extension accesses your Salesforce session ID ("sid" cookie) solely to authenticate and fetch metadata based on your account permissions.</p>

        <li>Fetching metadata related to Salesforce objects you have access to</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>We do not share your information with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>We take precautions to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
