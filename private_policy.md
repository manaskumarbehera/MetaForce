In this privacy policy, we seek to explain to you how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our MetaForce Chrome extension ("Extension").

## What Information We Collect

### Cookies

### Salesforce Data

## How We Use Information

- **To Improve the Extension**: We may use feedback you provide to improve the Extension.

## Data Retention

- The Extension does not store any personal data on our servers. All interactions happen within your local browser environment.

## Security

## Third-Party Services

- The Extension may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of those third-party websites.
